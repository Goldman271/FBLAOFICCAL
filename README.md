Welcome to InitTogether, an app for that will revolutionze how schools parents, and students communicate. 

How do I navigate through InItTogether?

The main run file is named as main.py. In this file you will greeted with lines of code that all implement the 
framework Flet. Flet is a similar framework to that of flutter which has been widely used for apps.

The FblaProject.db contains our sqlite3 database that has been used to store messages in our chatlog and contains the username and logins of all registered users.

The schoolClass.py file is where the new schools are being created and added by the admins of InItTogether.

In the SQLMigrations.py file, it creates and contains all the columns and tables that are needed to define our values in the database.
